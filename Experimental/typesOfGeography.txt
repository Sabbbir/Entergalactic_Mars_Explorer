**Group 1: Terrestrial Peaks**
- Crater(6): Argyre Planitia, Borealis Basin, Gale Crater, Hellas Planitia, Isidis Planitia, Jezero Crater
   - These are depressions on a planetary surface that are usually formed by impact events, such as asteroid or meteorite collisions.
- Mountain(3): Ascraeus Mons, Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons
   - These are elevated landforms that rise above the surrounding terrain due to geological processes like tectonic activity or volcanic eruptions.
- Volcano(3): Elysium Mons, Olympus Mons, Syrtis Major
   - These are mountains that are formed by the accumulation of lava, ash, and other materials ejected during volcanic eruptions.

**Group 2: Highlands**
- Highlands(3): Arabia Terra, Noachis Terra, Tharsis
   - These are areas of elevated terrain with rugged topography, often featuring mountains, hills, and plateaus.

**Group 3: Unique Surface Textures**
- Canyon(1): Valles Marineris
   - Canyons are deep, narrow valleys often formed by the erosion of water over time, exposing distinct layers of geological history.
- Dunes(1): Olympia Undae
   - Dunes are hills or ridges of sand formed by wind, creating unique textured landscapes.

**Group 4: Enigmatic Features**
- Plains(1): Amazonis Planitia
   - Plains are flat or gently rolling areas characterized by low relief and relatively smooth surfaces.
- Planitia(1): Acidalia Planitia
   - Planitia are low-lying, broad plains often associated with large impact basins and filled with sediment or lava flows.

**Group 5: Others**
- Miscellaneous features that don't fit neatly into the previous categories.
