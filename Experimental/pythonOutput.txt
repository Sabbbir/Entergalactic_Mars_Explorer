Type: Mountain
Name: Ascraeus Mons
Location: Tharsis
Description: Second-highest volcano on Mars. In 1971. The volcano was originally called North Spot because it was the northernmost of only four spots visible on the surface due to a global dust storm that was then enshrouding the planet. As the dust cleared, the spots were revealed to be extremely tall volcanoes whose summits had projected above the dust-laden, lower atmosphere.

Type: Mountain
Name: Arsia Mons
Location: Tharsis
Description: Fourth-highest volcano on Mars.  Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva. Historically, it was known as Nodus Gordii ("Gordian knot") before being renamed.

Type: Crater
Name: Gale Crater
Location: Arabia Terra
Description: Home to the Curiosity rover. It is probably a dry lake. It is 154 km (96 mi) in diameter and estimated to be about 3.5 to 3.8 billion years old. Mount Sharp is a mountain in the center of Gale and rises 5.5 km (18,000 ft) high. The NASA Mars rover Curiosity, of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission, landed in "Yellowknife" Quad 51 of Aeolis Palus in Gale at 05:32 UTC August 6, 2012.

Type: Crater
Name: Jezero Crater
Location: Isidis Planitia
Description: is a crater on Mars in the Syrtis Major quadrangle, about 45.0 km (28.0 mi) in diameter. Home to the Perseverance rover. Thought to have once been flooded with water, the crater contains a fan-delta deposit rich in clays. In some Slavic languages, the word jezero means 'lake'. In November 2018, it was announced that Jezero had been chosen as the landing site for the rover Perseverance as part of NASA's Mars 2020 mission.

Type: Dunes
Name: Olympia Undae
Location: Tharsis
Description: Olympia Undae consists of a broad "sand sea" or erg that partly rings the north polar plateau (Planum Boreum) from about 120° to 240°E longitude and 78° to 83°N latitude. Stretching about 1,100 km (680 mi) across and covering an area of 470,000 km2. is the largest continuous dune field on Mars.

Name: Amazonis Planitia
Location: Amazonis Planitia

Type: Highlands
Name: Tharsis
Location: Tharsis
Description: The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. It is called largest highland region on Mars. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. Water clouds can be seen over Tharsis

ID: 17
Type: Highlands
Name: Arabia Terra
Location: Arabia Terra
Description: Largest highland region in the northern hemisphere of Mars. It is densely cratered and heavily eroded. This battered topography indicates great age, and Arabia Terra is presumed to be one of the oldest terrains on the planet. It covers as much as 4,500 km (2,800 mi) at its longest extent
Coordinates: Latitude 21°N, Longitude 6°E

ID: 19
Type: Crater
Name: Borealis Basin
Location: Northern Hemisphere of Mars
Description: Largest and oldest impact basin on Mars, encompassing much of the northern lowlands. Some scientists have postulated that the basin formed during the impact of a single, large body roughly 2% of the mass of Mars, having a diameter of about 1,900 km (1,200 miles) early in the history of Mars, around 4.5 billion years ago. The basin is one of the flattest areas in the Solar System, and has an elliptical shape.
