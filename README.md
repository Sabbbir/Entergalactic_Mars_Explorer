# Entergalactic Mars Expedition


A 3d view of Mars with many important locations and pictures directly collected from Curiosity, Perseverance, opportunity and 
Also collected almost 9500 pictures from Ingenuity, a helicopter working on Mars. We compiled a video with all the pictures we collected. The task was really hard but we made it. Moreover we have a dedicated section for space enthusiasts so that they can see the picture of the day.

All the things above discussed, we made it with the help of nasa api. Our next plan is to implement the weather info of Mars. We tried but the api was not up to date. With the help of weather api, we can get different data.
